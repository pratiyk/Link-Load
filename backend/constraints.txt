# Constraints file for dependency version overrides
# Use with: pip install -c constraints.txt -r requirements.txt

# typing-extensions 4.15+ is required by pydantic 2.12+, mcp, etc.
# mitmproxy 12.2.1 declares <=4.14 but works fine with 4.15
# This constraint documents the intentional override
typing-extensions>=4.15.0

# Note: The mitmproxy typing-extensions constraint is overly restrictive.
# The library works correctly with typing-extensions 4.15.0.
# This will be resolved when mitmproxy updates their dependency bounds.
